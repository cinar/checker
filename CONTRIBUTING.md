# How to Contribute to Checker

This guide will help you contribute to the Checkers library.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone can contribute to Checkers library. No prior experience is required, but it is helpful to have some knowledge of coding.

## How to contribute?

Before you start contributing, please make sure to read our [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guide first.

### Did you find a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Project Issues](https://github.com/cinar/checker/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a fix?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Changes will be merged if they meet the project's coding standards and they are approved by the maintainers.

## Coding Standards

The project follows the Go coding standards.

### Code Quality

User input validation is a critical task that must be performed correctly in order to ensure that user data is handled correctly. This is why it is important to have extensive unit testing in place for any user input validation library. 

The Checker library has a code coverage threshold of 100%, which means that all of the code in the library has been tested. This ensures that the library is extremely reliable and that it will not fail to validate user input correctly.

The test cases for the library can be found in the _test.go files. These files contain a comprehensive set of tests that cover all of the possible scenarios for user input validation.

If you are planning to make a pull request to this project, please make sure to add enough test cases to ensure that the code coverage remains at 100%. This will help to ensure that the library remains reliable and that user data is handled correctly.

Thank you for contributing! We appreciate your help in making Checkers library better.
